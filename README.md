The Daily Mental Health Log is an interactive program designed to help users track their mental health and gratitude on a daily basis. By asking a series of questions, the program allows users to reflect on their feelings and experiences, storing their responses for future review. The program features a straightforward command-line interface, making it easy to use. Users are prompted to enter their name, their mood on a scale from 1-10, and three things they are grateful for each day. These responses are saved in a log file in JSON format, allowing for easy storage and retrieval. Users can also view their past responses to reflect on their progress and identify trends in their mental health. The core functionality includes recording daily responses, saving them to a file named ‘responses.json’, viewing past entries, and exiting the program. This project focuses on the essential features required to log daily mental health and gratitude entries.
